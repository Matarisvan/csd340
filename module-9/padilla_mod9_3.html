    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to Luis Manuel</h2>
    <p class="intro">My name is Luis Manuel Padilla Jr. and I was born to a Costa Rican mother and a <span id="race">________</span> father.
        The city that birthed me was Miami, Florida, but I grew up in a southern town in Georgia after my parents moved
        there when I was about a year and a half old. A couple of years later and I was introduced to my younger brother.
        We are a family of four.</p>
    <p>The first language I learned was <span id="language">_______</span> because that's all my parents would speak at home. They told me I could
        learn English at school, so I did not actually learn the English language until my fourth and fifth years of life.
        Now, I am more proficient at English, but I am fluent in both languages and would not struggle living in any
        country that speaks both.</p>
    <p>I like to say that I grew up "part time" in <span id="country">__________</span> since growing up I would spend every summer vacation there.
        As soon as the school year ended, we would head to Costa Rica and spend two to three months there at a time.
        I believe this drastically helped in my development and learning of the Spanish language as I would have no choice
        but to speak the local language when there.</p>
    <p>I have traveled to various countries throughout my life, but there are still many more that I would like to
        visit one day. <span class="sentence"> My favorite soccer team is AC Milan, and they are located in <span id="city">_____</span>, Italy.</span>
        I have not been there yet, but it is on my bucket list to travel there and watch them play live.</p>
